# STATSLIB: library with kernel machine learning method

Kernel method is a popular machine learning method, it enables us to deal with infinite functional space with finite machine memory. The kernel methods can help us transfer the non-linear function fitting to general linear problem, and encapsulates the nonlinearity inside the kernel functions. Understanding the property and capacity of the kernel function is essential in kernel-based method, such as kernel ridge regression, support vector machine, and this project is designed to setup my understanding. 

Currently I'm trying to explore two problem in this project, kernel capacity and gradient-based optimization method. Most machine learning library implement kernel learning algorithm in dual problem, while I'm going to deal with the primal problem directly with some convex optimization methods, since it's more intuitive to me and will not mass things up. 

This document will be updated as the project goes ......
